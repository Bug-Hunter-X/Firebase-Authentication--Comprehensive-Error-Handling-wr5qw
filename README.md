# Firebase Authentication: Comprehensive Error Handling

This example demonstrates robust error handling in Firebase authentication, covering common and uncommon error scenarios.  It goes beyond basic error checks to provide a more resilient login process.

**Problem:**
Standard Firebase authentication error handling often only addresses the most frequent errors ('auth/wrong-password', 'auth/user-not-found'). This example expands upon that to handle less common scenarios and provides a more robust solution.

**Solution:**
The improved code includes more comprehensive error handling, using a switch statement to manage different error codes.  It also logs detailed error information for debugging purposes, and provides example handling of different error scenarios.  Specific actions are suggested for handling certain error codes, but these can be modified to fit the application's requirements.

**Further Improvements:**

*   **Custom Error Messages:** Translate error codes into user-friendly messages.
*   **Retry Logic:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors.
*   **Network Handling:** Include checks for network connectivity issues.
*   **Security Considerations:**  Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
